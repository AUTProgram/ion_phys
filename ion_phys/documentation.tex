\section{Atomic Hamiltonian}
The Hamiltonian for an atom interacting with an external electromagnetic wave is given by

\subsection{Multipole matrix elements}

\section{Optical Bloch equations}
The time evolution of the density matrix is described by the Liouville equation
\begin{equation}
    \frac{d \rho}{dt} = \frac{i}{\hbar} [H, \rho]
\end{equation}
In the presence of relaxation, this is modified to
\begin{equation}
    \frac{d \rho}{dt} = \frac{i}{\hbar} [H, \rho] - L \rho,
\end{equation}
where $L$ is the Lindblad operator. If the coherent interaction is due to interaction with an electromagnetic wave,
the Hamiltonian takes the form found earlier.
It is then useful to move to a rotating frame via the transformation
\begin{equation}
    \sigma_{ij} = \rho_{ij} e^{i \omega_a t}
\end{equation}
The Hamiltonian thus becomes time-independent and takes the form
\begin{equation}
    \frac{d \sigma_{ij}}{dt} = K \sigma - L \sigma,
\end{equation}
which means that
